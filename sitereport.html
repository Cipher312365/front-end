    <h2>Learning the Basics of Web Development</h2>
    <p>My experience learning web development has been both challenging and rewarding. I started off with HTML and CSS, and quickly learned the basics of coding and design. However, as I started working on more complex projects, I ran into a lot of issues with debugging my code. There were many times when I felt frustrated and stuck, but I persevered and eventually figured out how to solve the problems I encountered.</p>

    <h2>Reflective Discussion of My Module Experience</h2>
    <p>Overall, my module experience has been a great learning opportunity. I've gained a lot of technical skills and knowledge, and have enjoyed working on different web development projects. However, I've also struggled with time management and staying on top of my assignments. In the future, I will need to work on my organization and time management skills to ensure that I am able to meet deadlines and complete tasks efficiently.</p>

    <h2>Development of My Site Over the Term</h2>
    <p>Over the course of the term, I developed a site that showcases my web development skills and experience. I focused on both the technical and design aspects of the site's user interface. For the design, I chose a clean and modern look, with a simple color scheme of black, white, and blue. I was inspired by sites such as CodePen and CSS-Tricks, which have a similar minimalistic design.</p>
    <p>For the technical side of the site, I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a responsive and functional layout. I used media queries to ensure that the site looks good on all screen sizes, and implemented some basic JavaScript functions to add interactivity to the site.</p>

    <h2>Validation Reports</h2>
    <p>Throughout the development of my site, I made sure to regularly validate my HTML and CSS code using the W3C validation service. Below are screenshots of the validation reports showing that my pages HTML and CSS validate:</p>
